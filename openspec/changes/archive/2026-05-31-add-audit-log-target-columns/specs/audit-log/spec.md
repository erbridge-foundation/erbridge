## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: audit_log table schema

The system SHALL provide an `audit_log` table with the following columns:

- `id` — `UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()`
- `occurred_at` — `TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()`
- `actor_account_id` — `UUID REFERENCES account(id) ON DELETE SET NULL`
- `actor_character_id` — `BIGINT` (EVE character ID, snapshot at write time, no FK)
- `actor_character_name` — `TEXT` (snapshot at write time, no FK)
- `event_type` — `TEXT NOT NULL`
- `details` — `JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'`
- `target_type` — `TEXT` (nullable; the kind of entity the action targeted, e.g. `'character'`, `'account'`, `'map'`, `'acl'`)
- `target_id` — `TEXT` (nullable; the stringified identifier of the target — an EVE character ID for `'character'` targets, a UUID for `'account'` / `'map'` / `'acl'` targets; no FK, snapshot)
- `target_name` — `TEXT` (nullable; the human-readable name of the target at write time — the character name for character targets, the target account's main character name for account targets; snapshot, no FK)

The `target_*` columns are nullable because not every recordable action has a distinct target.

The table SHALL have the following indexes:

- `audit_log_occurred_at_idx ON audit_log (occurred_at DESC)` — newest-first reads.
- `audit_log_actor_account_idx ON audit_log (actor_account_id) WHERE actor_account_id IS NOT NULL` — per-actor filters; partial because rows with NULL actor (system events) are not filtered by this axis.
- `audit_log_actor_character_idx ON audit_log (actor_character_id) WHERE actor_character_id IS NOT NULL` — per-character history queries; partial for the same reason.
- `audit_log_target_id_idx ON audit_log (target_type, target_id) WHERE target_id IS NOT NULL` — "all events against this entity" queries; partial because target-less rows do not participate.
- `audit_log_target_name_idx ON audit_log (LOWER(target_name)) WHERE target_name IS NOT NULL` — backs case-insensitive target-name search (`LOWER(target_name) = LOWER($1)` or prefix `LIKE`); partial for the same reason.

The `actor_account_id` foreign key SHALL use `ON DELETE SET NULL` so that historical audit rows survive a future hard-delete of an account row. The actor-character columns and all three `target_*` columns SHALL have no foreign key constraint; they are snapshots intended to outlive the referenced rows.

#### Scenario: Schema is created by migration
- **WHEN** the backend applies all migrations
- **THEN** the `audit_log` table exists with the ten columns and five indexes described above

#### Scenario: Actor account FK survives account row deletion
- **WHEN** an `account` row that is referenced by audit rows is hard-deleted
- **THEN** the audit rows remain; their `actor_account_id` becomes NULL; their `actor_character_id`, `actor_character_name`, `event_type`, `details`, and `target_*` columns are unchanged

#### Scenario: Actor character columns survive eve_character row deletion
- **WHEN** the `eve_character` row identified by an audit row's `actor_character_id` is hard-deleted
- **THEN** the audit row remains; its `actor_character_id` and `actor_character_name` are unchanged (no FK cascade)

#### Scenario: Target columns survive deletion of the referenced entity
- **GIVEN** an audit row with `target_type`, `target_id`, and `target_name` populated
- **WHEN** the entity identified by `target_id` (account, character, map, or acl) is later hard-deleted
- **THEN** the audit row's `target_type`, `target_id`, and `target_name` are unchanged (no FK cascade; they are snapshots)

#### Scenario: Existing rows are backfilled by the migration
- **GIVEN** `audit_log` rows that existed before this change (with `target_*` columns absent)
- **WHEN** the migration that adds the `target_*` columns is applied
- **THEN** each pre-existing row whose event has a derivable target has `target_type` and `target_id` populated from its `details`; `target_name` is populated where the target's name is recoverable at migration time and left NULL otherwise

### Requirement: AuditEvent enum is the catalogue of recordable actions

The system SHALL provide a Rust `AuditEvent` enum in `backend/src/audit/mod.rs` that enumerates every recordable action. Each variant SHALL carry the typed data needed to render the per-event JSON payload. The enum SHALL expose three methods:

- `event_type(&self) -> &'static str` — returns the snake_case identifier used in the `audit_log.event_type` column.
- `details(&self) -> serde_json::Value` — returns the per-event JSON payload written to `audit_log.details`.
- `target(&self) -> Option<AuditTarget>` — returns the entity the action targeted, or `None` for events with no distinct target.

`AuditTarget` SHALL be a struct exposing the target's kind, stringified id, and an optional resolved name:

```rust
pub struct AuditTarget {
    pub target_type: &'static str,      // "character" | "account" | "map" | "acl"
    pub target_id: String,              // EVE id (character) or UUID (account/map/acl), stringified
    pub name: AuditTargetName,
}
```

`AuditTargetName` SHALL distinguish three cases so `record_in_tx` knows whether a write-time lookup is required:

- a name already known to the event (e.g. the `character_name` a variant carries) — written directly to `target_name`;
- an **account** whose name SHALL be resolved at write time as the target account's main character name (snapshot, fail-soft);
- no name available — `target_name` is NULL.

The catalogue SHALL be defined in full, including variants for features that do not yet emit any rows. This keeps `event_type` strings stable across future changes that activate currently-dormant variants. Every variant — emitted or dormant — SHALL return its correct `target()` so that activating a dormant variant later requires no audit-side change.

The per-variant target mapping SHALL be:

- `AccountRegistered`, `AccountReactivated`, `AccountPurged`, `AccountDeletionRequested` → target_type `"account"`, target_id the affected `account_id`, name resolved from the account's main.
- `OrphanCharacterClaimed`, `CharacterAdded` → target_type `"character"`, target_id the `eve_character_id`, name the carried `character_name`.
- `CharacterRemoved`, `CharacterSetMain` → target_type `"character"`, target_id the `eve_character_id`, name not carried (NULL).
- `ApiKeyCreated`, `ApiKeyRevoked` → target_type `"account"`, target_id the `account_id` (the key belongs to the actor's account; the account is the target entity), name resolved from the account's main.
- `ServerAdminGranted`, `ServerAdminRevoked` → target_type `"account"`, target_id the affected `account_id`, name resolved from the account's main.
- `EveCharacterBlocked`, `EveCharacterUnblocked` → target_type `"character"`, target_id the `eve_character_id`, name not carried (NULL).
- `MapCreated`, `MapDeleted`, `AdminMapHardDeleted` → target_type `"map"`, target_id the `map_id`, name the carried map `name`.
- `AdminMapOwnershipChanged` → target_type `"map"`, target_id the `map_id`, name not carried (NULL).
- `AclCreated`, `AclRenamed`, `AclDeleted`, `AdminAclHardDeleted` → target_type `"acl"`, target_id the `acl_id`, name the carried acl `name` (for `AclRenamed`, the `new_name`).
- `AclMemberAdded`, `AclMemberPermissionChanged`, `AclMemberRemoved`, `AclAttachedToMap`, `AclDetachedFromMap`, `AdminAclOwnershipChanged` → target_type `"acl"`, target_id the `acl_id`, name not carried (NULL).

The catalogue SHALL contain the variants and `event_type` strings already defined by the shipped capability (unchanged by this change), plus `ServerAdminGrantSource` as specified there. This change adds no variant and renames none; it adds only the `target()` method and the mapping above.

The exact JSON shape of `details()` per variant SHALL be unchanged by this change.

#### Scenario: target() returns the account target with a name-lookup marker for account events
- **GIVEN** an `AuditEvent::ServerAdminGranted { account_id, source }`
- **WHEN** `target()` is called
- **THEN** it returns `Some(AuditTarget)` with `target_type = "account"`, `target_id = account_id.to_string()`, and a name marked for write-time resolution from the account's main

#### Scenario: target() returns the character target with the carried name
- **GIVEN** an `AuditEvent::CharacterAdded { account_id, eve_character_id, character_name }`
- **WHEN** `target()` is called
- **THEN** it returns `Some(AuditTarget)` with `target_type = "character"`, `target_id = eve_character_id.to_string()`, and the carried `character_name` as the name

#### Scenario: target() returns a nameless character target where no name is carried
- **GIVEN** an `AuditEvent::EveCharacterBlocked { eve_character_id, reason }`
- **WHEN** `target()` is called
- **THEN** it returns `Some(AuditTarget)` with `target_type = "character"`, `target_id = eve_character_id.to_string()`, and no name (so `target_name` will be NULL)

#### Scenario: Every variant returns a target
- **WHEN** `target()` is called for any variant defined in the catalogue
- **THEN** it returns `Some(AuditTarget)` with the `target_type`, `target_id`, and name disposition given in the per-variant mapping above (no variant returns `None` in the current catalogue, but the method's return type permits `None` for future target-less variants)

### Requirement: record_in_tx writes a single audit row participating in the caller's transaction

The system SHALL provide an async function `audit::record_in_tx` with the signature:

```rust
pub async fn record_in_tx(
    tx: &mut Transaction<'_, Postgres>,
    actor_account_id: Option<Uuid>,
    acting_as: Option<ActingCharacter>,
    event: AuditEvent,
) -> Result<()>
```

where `ActingCharacter` is a struct `{ eve_character_id: i64, name: String }`.

The function SHALL INSERT a single row into `audit_log` with `event_type = event.event_type()`, `details = event.details()`, and the `target_type` / `target_id` / `target_name` columns populated from `event.target()`. The write SHALL execute against the passed transaction so it commits with — or rolls back with — the state change in the same transaction.

Actor-column resolution SHALL follow these rules, in order:

1. If `actor_account_id` is `Some(id)`, the function SHALL look up the account's main character (the unique `eve_character` row with `account_id = id AND is_main = TRUE`) within the same transaction. If found, `actor_character_id` and `actor_character_name` SHALL be populated from that row's `eve_character_id` and `name`. The looked-up `id` SHALL be written to `actor_account_id`.
2. Else if `acting_as` is `Some(c)`, the function SHALL write NULL to `actor_account_id`, `c.eve_character_id` to `actor_character_id`, and `c.name` to `actor_character_name`.
3. Else (both `None`), the function SHALL write NULL to all three actor columns.

Target-column resolution SHALL follow from `event.target()`:

1. If `target()` is `None`, all three target columns SHALL be NULL.
2. If `target()` is `Some(t)`, `target_type` SHALL be `t.target_type` and `target_id` SHALL be `t.target_id`.
3. `target_name` SHALL be populated according to `t`'s name disposition:
   - a directly-carried name SHALL be written as-is;
   - an account-name disposition SHALL trigger a lookup of the **target account's** main character within the same transaction; the main's name SHALL be snapshotted into `target_name`. If the lookup returns no row (invariant violation), the function SHALL emit a `tracing::error!` identifying the missing main and the event_type, write `target_name = NULL`, and continue (fail-soft — identical discipline to the actor snapshot);
   - no name SHALL leave `target_name` NULL.

The main-character lookup for the actor and for an account target MAY be the same query when the actor account and the target account are the same id; the function MAY reuse a single lookup in that case.

#### Scenario: Audit row commits with the state change
- **WHEN** a service starts a transaction, performs a state change, calls `record_in_tx`, and commits
- **THEN** both the state change and the audit row are visible to subsequent transactions
- **WHEN** a service starts a transaction, performs a state change, calls `record_in_tx`, and the transaction is rolled back before commit
- **THEN** neither the state change nor the audit row is visible to subsequent transactions

#### Scenario: actor_account_id resolves the main character snapshot
- **GIVEN** an account with a main character (eve_character_id 12345, name "Test Pilot")
- **WHEN** `record_in_tx(tx, Some(account_id), None, event)` is called
- **THEN** the inserted row has `actor_account_id = account_id`, `actor_character_id = 12345`, `actor_character_name = "Test Pilot"`

#### Scenario: acting_as path used when no session exists yet
- **WHEN** `record_in_tx(tx, None, Some(ActingCharacter { eve_character_id: 99999, name: "Signing In" }), event)` is called
- **THEN** the inserted row has `actor_account_id = NULL`, `actor_character_id = 99999`, `actor_character_name = "Signing In"`

#### Scenario: System events leave all actor columns NULL
- **WHEN** `record_in_tx(tx, None, None, event)` is called
- **THEN** the inserted row has `actor_account_id = NULL`, `actor_character_id = NULL`, `actor_character_name = NULL`

#### Scenario: Main-character lookup miss falls soft with tracing error
- **GIVEN** an account whose main-character lookup unexpectedly returns no row
- **WHEN** `record_in_tx(tx, Some(account_id), None, event)` is called
- **THEN** the function emits a `tracing::error!` describing the missing main and the event_type, the inserted row has `actor_account_id = account_id` but `actor_character_id = NULL` and `actor_character_name = NULL`, and the function returns `Ok(())`

#### Scenario: Character-target columns are written from the event
- **GIVEN** an `AuditEvent::CharacterAdded { account_id, eve_character_id: 555, character_name: "Alt Pilot" }`
- **WHEN** `record_in_tx(tx, Some(account_id), None, event)` is called
- **THEN** the inserted row has `target_type = "character"`, `target_id = "555"`, and `target_name = "Alt Pilot"`

#### Scenario: Account-target name snapshots the target account's main
- **GIVEN** a target account whose main character is (eve_character_id 222, name "Boss Pilot")
- **WHEN** `record_in_tx` is called for an `AuditEvent::ServerAdminGranted { account_id: <target>, source }` (with the actor being a different admin account)
- **THEN** the inserted row has `target_type = "account"`, `target_id = "<target uuid>"`, and `target_name = "Boss Pilot"` (snapshotted from the target account's main, independent of the actor)

#### Scenario: Account-target name lookup miss falls soft
- **GIVEN** a target account that has no main character (invariant violation)
- **WHEN** `record_in_tx` is called for an account-targeted event against that account
- **THEN** the function emits a `tracing::error!` identifying the missing target main and the event_type, the inserted row has `target_type = "account"` and `target_id` set but `target_name = NULL`, and the function returns `Ok(())`

#### Scenario: Target-less disposition leaves target columns NULL
- **GIVEN** an event whose `target()` returns `None`
- **WHEN** `record_in_tx` is called
- **THEN** the inserted row has `target_type = NULL`, `target_id = NULL`, and `target_name = NULL`

### Requirement: list_audit_log reads newest-first with three filter axes and a keyset cursor

The system SHALL provide an async function `audit::list_audit_log` returning `Vec<AuditLogEntry>` where each `AuditLogEntry` carries `id`, `occurred_at`, `actor_account_id`, `actor_character_id`, `actor_character_name`, `event_type`, `details`, `target_type`, `target_id`, and `target_name`.

The function SHALL accept these optional filter axes plus a keyset cursor and limit, all bound as parameters (no string interpolation, no SQL injection surface):

- `event_type: Option<&str>` — if `Some`, restricts to rows where `event_type` matches; if `None`, no restriction.
- `actor_account_id: Option<Uuid>` — if `Some`, restricts to rows where `actor_account_id` matches; if `None`, no restriction.
- `target_type: Option<&str>` — if `Some`, restricts to rows where `target_type` matches; if `None`, no restriction.
- `target_id: Option<&str>` — if `Some`, restricts to rows where `target_id` matches; if `None`, no restriction.
- `target_name: Option<&str>` — if `Some`, restricts to rows where `LOWER(target_name)` matches the lowercased argument (case-insensitive; backed by the `LOWER(target_name)` expression index); if `None`, no restriction.
- `before: Option<DateTime<Utc>>` — if `Some`, restricts to rows where `occurred_at < before` (keyset cursor for newest-first pagination); if `None`, no restriction.
- `limit: i64` — maximum rows to return; the caller is responsible for clamping to a sensible upper bound.

Results SHALL be ordered by `occurred_at DESC` (newest first). When multiple filter axes are supplied they SHALL be combined conjunctively (AND).

#### Scenario: List with no filters returns rows newest-first
- **GIVEN** several `audit_log` rows
- **WHEN** `list_audit_log` is called with all filters `None` and a limit
- **THEN** all rows are returned in descending `occurred_at` order, capped at the `limit`, each carrying its `target_*` columns

#### Scenario: Filter by target_id restricts to that entity's events
- **GIVEN** audit rows targeting several entities
- **WHEN** `list_audit_log` is called with `target_type = Some("character")` and `target_id = Some("555")`
- **THEN** only rows whose `target_type = "character"` and `target_id = "555"` are returned

#### Scenario: Filter by target_name is case-insensitive
- **GIVEN** an audit row with `target_name = "Boss Pilot"`
- **WHEN** `list_audit_log` is called with `target_name = Some("boss pilot")`
- **THEN** that row is returned (the match lowercases both sides)

#### Scenario: Target filters combine with actor and event_type filters
- **GIVEN** mixed audit rows
- **WHEN** `list_audit_log` is called with both `event_type = Some("server_admin_granted")` and `target_name = Some("boss pilot")`
- **THEN** only rows matching both conditions are returned

#### Scenario: before cursor advances pagination
- **GIVEN** a previous page's oldest `occurred_at = T`
- **WHEN** `list_audit_log` is called with `before = Some(T)`
- **THEN** only rows with `occurred_at < T` are returned, supporting stable keyset pagination under concurrent inserts
